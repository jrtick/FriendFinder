Project Title: Friend Finder
Project Domain: http://friendfinder.nodejs.love
Name: Jordan Tick (jrtick)
Email: jrtick@andrew.cmu.edu
Details:
  1) You create an account with a username and password.
  2) You can see all members and add whichever as friends.
  3) Once you log in, you see a google maps of the area that shows
       whichever of your friends are currently logged in.
  4) You get an alert if someone is within 1/4 mile of you.
  5) If time permits, I'll add in the ability to chat with whoever is
      within a 1/4 mile of you!

  ** Steps 4 and 5 would use socket.io. Step 3 would just use google api
       to retrieve map and coordinates
  ** I will try to make this mobile browser friendly
